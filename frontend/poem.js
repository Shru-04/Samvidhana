const poem = `The sun was setting,
The moon hurried for work
The stars peeked over the clouds
And blinked as the brown man stared at it
Little did he know that the tides would bring him
A stout white baton that would change his life

He picked it up and he felt powerful
So he smacked another man with it
And he bowed down with fear,
He smacked another and another and another
And all kneeled before him
Until finally he was tired and slept
The white baton waited upon this
And rose to knock him dead
And now the men that bowed to him had to bow to it
Another man picked this baton with the same greed
And another group fell
And this went on until the whole glorious country ripped itself apart and fell under it
For 200 years the baton stood sturdy
The fear of its smack kept the brown man on his knees
The fear made his head droop down

He forgot about the sky and the stars
And fell to the ground
He fell to the ground with dirt in his mouth
The worms crawled over his body and he rotted
But one man rolled over and lay on his back
And he saw
He saw a bird fly, wings fully to the side
Lashing with all its might
He saw and fell in love
It was clear
He wanted one thing and he would give anything for it
He would give anything for him to flutter his wings
And break free from the shackles of the proud white baton

So he rose and walked
The baton smacked him hard and knocked him unconscious
The others laughed
But he opened his eyes and saw the sky
He rose again and he walked
And he was smacked again
This time they just ignored him
But he rose again
This time they were curious
He was a man who had nothing to lose
And would settle at nothing but absolute freedom
This was infectious
Now five men rose and were knocked down
Then fifty
The men walked and when they were smacked
Their blood which aimlessly flowed in their veins for 200 years spurred out
And became the nectar of freedom
It washed the baton of all its stains and soaked it
It made it soft
The baton could not take it anymore

It smacked and smacked but they would rise again
Many died but that too didn’t stop them
They rose again and walked
They walked to get off the ground
To force open their cage
And the universe conspired
It sent them men of steel veins and iron wills
Who would die a hundred deaths
But would not stay down
Until one day the baton couldn’t do anything more and stopped
It set them free and disappeared in the waves
These men tired from battle fell on their backs

This time face up
And stared at the sky
But couldn’t see the stars
For it was cloudy
The sky was clouded with the blood of hundreds of thousands of men and woman
Who shunned their lives for freedom
But after the clutter cleared the stars would rise again
And we can look up and gaze at them again
Until we can throw away the batons that reach our hands
